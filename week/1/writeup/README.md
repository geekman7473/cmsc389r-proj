One of the fundamental ethical responsibilities of Engineer is to prevent harm. In this situation, while it would be important to "blow the whistle," it is possible that disclosing the details of this vulnerability publicly could leave unwitting consumers open to attack. The most ethical course of action would be to document the issue and report it to your direct supervisor. If your supervisor does not take your advisement seriously, you may need to elevate the situation yourself to your next level of management up. It also may be useful to report the situation to your organizations cybersecurity team, if you have one. If all of these steps fail, and no action is taken to correct the situation, then it may be valid to take the situation public or to a watchdog organization. This is especially true if the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release. If the company moves forward with the release without resolving the concern, your company will more thank likely be held liable for the harm it causes. With that being said, if you do *nothing* then you will need to live with being at least partially responsible for the harm that may be caused by hostile actors abusing this vulnerability. You are not likely to be found criminally or civily liable for your inaction, but from an ethical perspective I believe you would be guilty. Additionally, if you do not act, you would not be ethically serving your employer, since you know the cost that fixing the vulnerability would entail.
